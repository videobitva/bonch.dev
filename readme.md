## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications.

## ReadMe

API Routes (register,login,logout) are set in the /routes/api.php

. Registration
* URL: /api/register
* Data: {name:"Name", email:"example@email.com", password:"password"}
* Type: Post

Note: After doing this user gets Email for account verification. Until it's not done he wouldn't be able to log in.


. Logging in
* URL: /api/login
* Data: {login:"login@email.com",password:"password"}
* Type: Post
This will return you JSON response with info about success/fail, and in case of success token for passing through the JWT Authentication.

Other info could be accessed in AuthController.php and api.php
